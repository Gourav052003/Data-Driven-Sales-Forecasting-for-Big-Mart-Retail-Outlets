## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the sales of each product in different outlets based on various product attributes and store-related information. The data was collected from 10 stores for 1559 products across different cities in 2013. This project can help BigMart optimize inventory management, improve pricing strategies, and ultimately boost revenue by accurately predicting future sales.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

- **Item_Identifier**: Unique product ID
- **Item_Weight**: Weight of the product
- **Item_Fat_Content**: Whether the product is low-fat or regular
- **Item_Visibility**: The percentage of total display area allocated to the product
- **Item_Type**: The category to which the product belongs
- **Item_MRP**: Maximum retail price of the product
- **Outlet_Identifier**: Unique store ID
- **Outlet_Establishment_Year**: The year the outlet was established
- **Outlet_Size**: The size of the outlet (Small, Medium, High)
- **Outlet_Location_Type**: The type of area where the outlet is located
- **Outlet_Type**: Whether the outlet is a grocery store or a supermarket
- **Item_Outlet_Sales**: The target variable (sales)
